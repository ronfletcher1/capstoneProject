                    Unlike hitting with the wind at your back or in your face, 
                    playing through a strong crosswind isn’t a simple matter of 
                    changing clubs and maybe tweaking your technique. A sideways 
                    wind turns aiming into a guessing game, may or may not affect 
                    your club selection, and can cause huge havoc on a slight miscue.
                    Of course, a crosswind can be a great advantage in the right 
                    situation – but only if you’re prepared for it. We’ve got several 
                    tips that will boost your odds:
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>Go with your normal shot: A crosswind gives you two options 
                    – curve the ball into the wind, or curve it with the wind. 
                    Unless you’re an advanced golfer with the skill to shape shots 
                    in either direction, your best bet is to go with your natural 
                    shot. If you typically hit a fade (left-to-right curve for a 
                    right-hander), aim farther left in a left-to-right wind; aim 
                    straight at the target in a right-to-left breeze, letting the two 
                    forces cancel each other out.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>Play a runner that rides the crosswind: The situation – left-to-right 
                    wind, flag on the right, no hazards guarding the green’s front left. 
                    Opportunity knocks. Play it correctly and the wind will take your ball 
                    straight to the hole. Aim well left and set up for a straight shot or 
                    slight fade, with the goal of landing the ball just short and left of 
                    the green. Then watch the wind work its magic. Always look for spots 
                    where the green is open on the side from which the wind is blowing.
                    Take more club if fighting wind, less club going with it: If you decide 
                    to hit a shot that curves into the wind, take an extra club as the wind 
                    will increase the ball’s backspin, knock it down and minimize roll. 
                    Conversely, play less club when your shot matches the wind direction as 
                    backspin is diminished and the ball will fly and roll farther. Find 
                    the safest spot to miss: The first thing to assess is whether the wind 
                    is blowing toward or away from trouble. If the answer is “toward,” you’ll 
                    want to aim as far as possible from the hazard to make absolutely certain 
                    you don’t find it. Wind blowing away from trouble? Take a more aggressive 
                    line and trust the wind to steer the ball toward safety.

                    Wind affects these shots too! Pitching into a stronger breeze 
                    will all but stop your shots’ roll out. Conversely, chipping 
                    and pitching downwind will make it roll out a lot more. The ball 
                    can even move side to side from as little as 30 yards from the 
                    hole. When pitching into the wind, follow the same rules as the 
                    approach shot. Take a stronger club and swing easier. This will 
                    help you control spin and help the shot roll out like you thought 
                    it would.

                    In order to lessen the impact of a stiff breeze, you’ll want 
                    to hit the ball lower than normal. In order to accomplish this, 
                    play the ball back further in your stance. Try putting it back 
                    about an inch farther back than normal and you’ll find that the 
                    ball comes out lower and stays under the wind better.
