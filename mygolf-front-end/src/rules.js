        content:
            'When the first written code of golf Rules appeared in 1744, the authors could not have imagined the technological advancements to come and how they would influence many aspects of the game. Whether the issue is equipment, turf management, or the use of high-tech devices to assist the player, the Rules of Golf must address the introduction of new technologies to the game. The Rules of Golf allow a player to use a multi-functional device, such as a smartphone or tablet, to make a phone call, send a text message or check football scores between holes. With the introduction on Jan. 1, 2014 of Decision 14-3/18 - Weather Information Accessed on Multi-Functional Device, accessing local weather information such as temperature, wind speed and direction, humidity, and radar on such a device is also permissible.'
