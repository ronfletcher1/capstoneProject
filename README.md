# Description

## Issue:  
Correct club selection in wind and varying elevations.  Selecting the 
correct club to use for golf shots will vary depending on the wind 
speed, wind direction, and elevation. Here in GA alone avg wind speeds vary from an avg between 9.11 mph to Waynesville GA 25 mph

## Resolution: 
MyGolfConditions updates the golfer on the 
current weather conditions wherever they are playing 
golf so they may make the proper club selection

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js

## Challennges
The biggest challenge was dealing with the compass and orientation. 
Golfing requires you to face in difeerent directions depending on the 
location and direction of the hole.  On one hole you could be facing north and have a tailwind and vice-versa.  This was overcome by converting the the wind degrees into the golf wind type and using the golf wind type and wind speed to estimate the correct club to use.

## MVP Features:
Weather API Wind speed display
Weather API Wind direction display
Weather API Temperature
Golf Wind Type
Club Suggestion Display

## Stretch Features
API Elevation display
Elevation Club Distance
Back-end
Payment Plans for up to the minute API weather calls


## How It Works:
User inputs thier golf clubs and distance range. On the landing 
page, the user will input the zip code for the course they are playing.  The user then enters the distance to the hole on the approach shot for a par for or par five.  MyGolfConditions will display the golf conditions for the weather (Current Temperature, Wind Speed, Wind Gust speed,the direction the Wind is Blowing From, the type of Golf Wind (tailwind, headwind, crosswind, or 
quarterwind)).  MyGolfConditions will display the the estimated distance based on the golf conditions and will render the best club to be used.

# Rules of Golf
When the first written code of golf Rules appeared in 1744, the authors could not have imagined the technological advancements to come and how they would influence many aspects of the game. Whether the issue is equipment, turf management, or the use of high-tech devices to assist the player, the Rules of Golf must address the introduction of new technologies to the game. The Rules of Golf allow a player to use a multi-functional device, such as a smartphone or tablet, to make a phone call, send a text message or check football scores between holes. With the introduction on Jan. 1, 2014 of Decision 14-3/18 - Weather Information Accessed on Multi-Functional Device, accessing local weather information such as temperature, wind speed and direction, humidity, and radar on such a device is also permissible.
